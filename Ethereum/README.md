Looking at the advantages offered by Bitcoin − a digital currency, people wanted to use the concept of Blockchain in their own applications. People wanted to move out of their physical contracts to smart digital contracts where several issues like repudiation, transparency, security, etc. would be automatically addressed. The outcome of this effort resulted in the creation of [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) − a popular platform for creating distributed Blockchain applications that support smart contracts.

This documentation is designed to help you build with Ethereum. It covers Ethereum as a concept, explains the Ethereum tech stack, and documents advanced topics for more complex applications and use cases.
